# NP_scRNAseq_analysis
#Project Description : Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is a condition that refers to the wearing of the disc, causing lower back pain. There are multiple treatments available for IDD, but they do not provide complete relief. Regenerative cell therapy has arisen as a new method in recent years that effectively helps the disc to regenerate. Disc cells are grown primarily in Foetal bovine serum (FBS). Using FBS raises various ethical concerns and poses a risk of microbial contamination. Multiple substitutes currently exist that can be used instead of xenogenic media. We aim to assess non-xenogenic media as an alternative to FBS in the expansion of intervertebral disc cells by transcriptome analysis. We will used CIBERSORTx to estimate and compare the population of cells regenerated in various media. The scripts were used to preprocess healthy  Nucleus Pulposus scRNA-seq dataset and convert it into a reference file for the generation of Signature matrix in CIBERSORTX. The signature matrix was further used to estimate cell fractions in the bulk RNA-seq data of the samples grown in various media supplement. Chondrocytes and NP_Progenitor cells were observed in the bulk RNAseq samples. Their cell fractions were then compared using Two-way ANOVA, the code for the same also provided in the script.
